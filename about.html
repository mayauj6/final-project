    <p class="appearances">Appearances are deceiving.</p>
    <p class="blurb" id="head">Domestic Violence happens behind closed doors. While on the surface, a domestic
      situation may appear safe, what lies beneath can be dangerous, harmful, and even life threatening.</p>

    <p class="why">Why Hover?</p>
    <p class="blurb">You may have been confused when you discovered the hidden hover elements on our page.
      We wanted to create a site that visually simulates the harsh
      reality of domestic violence. The bright colors and fake cover "Family Wellness"
      page represents the way domestic violence is a hidden layer below a seemingly
      picture perfect situation</p>
    <p class="why">Why EMMber?</p>
    <p class="blurb">The name for our site sprung from an acronym of our first
    names: Ella, Maya, and Manlin, or the EMM in EMMber. Ember, a small piece of glowing coal
  in fire, to us represents the hope and potential domestic violence victims have and how even
 as their fire is dying, there is potential to ignite a fire and invoke change to escape their situation.</p>
  <p class="why">You Can't Ignore the Layers</p>
  <p class="blurb">Domestic violence can be so easy for people to ignore. There are often no witnesses, and getting
    involed seems like it hurt more than it would help. However, much like our website, it should be impossible to ignore the hidden layers.  
    Yet, by publicly speaking out against domestic violence, together
 we can challenge attitudes towards violence in the home and show that domestic violence is a crime and not merely unacceptable.</p>
