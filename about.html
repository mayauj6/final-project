    <p class="blurb" id="head">Domestic Violence happens behind closed doors. While on the surface, a domestic
      situation may appear safe, what lies beneath can be dangerous, harmful, and even life threatening.</p>

    <p class="why">Why Hover?</p>
    <p class="blurb">We wanted to create a site that visually simulates the harsh
      reality of domestic violence. The bright colors and fake cover "Family Wellness"
      page represents the way doemstic violence are a hidden layer below a seemingly
      picture perfect situation</p>
    <p class="why">Why EMMber?</p>
    <p class="blurb">The name for our site sprung from an acronym of our first
    names: Ella, Maya, and Manlin, or the EMM in EMMber. Ember, a small piece of glowing coal
  in fire, to us represents the hope and potential domestic violence victims have and how even
 as their fire is dying, there is potential to ignite a fire and invoke change to escape their situation.</p>
